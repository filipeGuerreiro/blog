Blog written using the blueface Jekyll theme.
This will serve as a personal journal for things I learn about as I go through life either at work, side projects, and personal.

## Tags

- Work: 
Lessons learned from paid work. To help me stay organized and not let important ideas slip through the cracks. This also serves as a way to measure the pulse on I am feeling about the work I am doing and the progress being made.

- Side projects:
Lessons captured related to open source software, hobbies, etc. that might be worth sharing in a public forum at some point but currently is raw material.

- Personal: 
For private thoughts and ideas of use only to me. This might include health, mood, personal reflections, relationships, etc.
