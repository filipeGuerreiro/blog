My name is Filipe Guerreiro and I am currently working as a Software Developer in the financial tech industry in Tokyo Japan.

I have spent the last 2+ years getting my hands dirty in back-end, API and end-to-end testing projects with a strong interest in database systems and data pipelines. 
So far, I have experience working in small, agile teams building projects from scratch as well as maintaining existing legacy systems.

I have several interests that I continue working on in my freetime. You may see these pop up from time to time alongside code-related posts!

Thanks for reading!
